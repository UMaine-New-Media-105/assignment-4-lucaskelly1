Question 1: 
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/4u-xkiOnX
--
This code uses p5js objects to create different stars. 
It uses a loop to pass different perameters to each star. 
There is a white, red, yellow, and blue star that each 
have a different number of points. 


Question 2: 
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/DO4wQNQEg
--
This is all similer to question 1, but instead includes 
a for loop to tile the shapes. 

Question 3: 
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/tgCLjKlp_
--
This code shows how the tiles perameters could be randomized 
and now show many different looking stars in random locations. 

Question 4:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/6ZU4z_M8g
--
This code creates a static image of a pattern of the stars, 
as well as a moon shape. It is done with an array that tells 
the order of the shapes.
